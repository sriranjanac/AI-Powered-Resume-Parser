# AI Powered Resume Parser

## üöÄ Overview
This project is a web-based AI-powered resume parser designed to streamline the recruitment process by automating the extraction of information from resumes. Built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) model, it transforms unstructured resume data into a structured format like JSON or Excel, enhancing accessibility for automated recruitment. The parsed results can be downloaded for future use as well.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Multi-format Parsing**: Supports single or multiple resume uploads in PDF format.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes BiLSTM to capture contextual information for precise information extraction.
- **NLP-Powered**: Includes tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and keyword matching for enhanced data preprocessing.
- **Structured Output**: Outputs parsed data in organized formats (JSON/Excel).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Flask-based application for easy resume parsing and real-time result viewing

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- BiLSTM for deep learning-based information extraction.
- Flask for creating a user-friendly web interface.
**Libraries:**
  - pdfplumber: Extracts text from PDF resumes.
  - nltk / spacy: Text preprocessing and tokenization.
  - numpy / tensorflow: Model building and training.
  - pandas: Organizes and exports parsed data.
    
**Data Output:**
  - JSON and Excel formats for structured data representation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
- Clone the repository
- Install the virtual environment and dependencies
- Train the model and run the flask Application
